Import required libraries, read the airline data, and create an application layout\n","2.  Add title to the dashboard using HTML H1 component\n","3.  Add a HTML division and core text input component inside the division. Provide an input component id and a default value to the component.\n","4.  Add a HTML dividion and core graph component.
